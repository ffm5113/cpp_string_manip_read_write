# cpp_string_manip_read_write
The String Manipulator Read/Write Program (C++) reads a .txt file containing a list of fake personal data, such as names, addresses, etc. Lines of the file are changed to comma separated values (CSV) format. Finally, a .txt file is written using the newly formatted CSV data.

cout is utilized to print to the console, while an fstream object fout is used to print to the .txt file.
